Snowman is an advanced Twine 2 story format designed for people who already know JavaScript and CSS. It was originally created by Chris Klimas and is currently maintained by Dan Cox.

## What does Snowman offer?

Snowman does not use macros. Instead, it provides template tags, `<% ... %>`, and a JavaScript API for accessing and manipulating the current story and its passages.

It also includes the JavaScript library [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

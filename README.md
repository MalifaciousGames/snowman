# Snowman

Snowman was originally created by Chris Klimas as a "minimal Twine 2 story format designed for people who already know JavaScript and CSS." In 2022, with the move to 3.X, Dan Cox has changed the description to "an advanced Twine 2 story format designed for people who already know JavaScript and CSS."

## What does Snowman offer?

Snowman does not use macros like Harlowe, SugarCube, and other story formats. Instead, it uses template tags `<% ... %>` and exposes a rich JavaScript API for manipulating the story and its passages.

It also includes the JavaScript library [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
